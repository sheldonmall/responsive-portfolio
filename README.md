## Usage 

The Home page of my website loads when launched. This is the landing page that shows a navigation bar on the top. These are the option available on the navigation bar:

* About Me: This link takes you to tha page that details my experience in the software and applications industry.

## Credits

There are no contributors to this project.

However, I have used templates and contructs from different activites we have done so far in this program. In fact, I had been working on a personal website since the beginning of the program and had been revising it with each new concept and feature we had learning.

I have used **Bootstrap CDN** as well as referenced the `reset.css` and `style.css` that have been available to us as part of this program.


## License

There is no need for any license at the moment to use my website.

## Tests

My website is simple to use. I have tested it throughly to ensure all links work and the website is responsive to different screen sizes. 

Do let me know if you come across any errors while testing or browsing my website. I will appreciate all and any feedback too!
